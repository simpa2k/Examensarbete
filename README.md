# Examensarbete

This experiment is being written as part of my bachelor's thesis at the Department of Computer and Systems Sciences at 
Stockholm University. It uses the feature set developed by (Posnett, Hindle & Devanbu 2011) to predict the readability of
solutions to a first-year programming assignment, all written in Java.
